# Sudoku

This is an Android Sudoku game. It should work on all versions of Android starting from Jelly Bean (4.2).

If you trust me feel free to download and install the .apk file.
You can also take the source as a basis to build your own game.

If you have any questions or remarks please send me a mail on ds21h@hotmail.com
